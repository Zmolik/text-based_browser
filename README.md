# text-based_browser  
Simplified  text-based browser that ignores JS and CSS, don't have cookies, and show a limited set of tags. Gives an option to read online documentation or find something on the Internet from the command line or terminal.  
  
**Learning outcomes**   
In this project, I've learned how HTTP works, how to parse HTML and how to work with it in Python. I've become familiar with Python input and output.  

**How it works**
-  python browser.py dir-for-files (start browser through command line or terminal, "dir-for-files" represents directory where the internet pages will be saved)
-  docs.python.org (input web address with or without https://)
-  back (this command will show previous page)
-  exit (to quit the app)
